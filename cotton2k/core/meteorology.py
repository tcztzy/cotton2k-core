    """Computes the hourly values of wind speed (m/sec), estimated from the measured
    total daily wind run.

    The algorithm is described by Ephrath et al. (1996). It is based on the following
    assumptions:

    Although the variability of wind speed during any day is very large, the diurnal
    wind speed curves appear to be characterized by the following repetitive pattern:
    increase in wind speed from time `t1` in the morning to time `t2` in the afternoon,
    decrease from `t2` to `t3` in the evening, and a low constant wind speed at night,
    from `t3` to `t1` in the next day.

    The values of `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` have been determined in the calling routine:
    `t1` is `SitePar(1)` hours after sunrise, `t2` is `SitePar(2)` hours after solar
    noon, and `t3` is `SitePar(3)` hours after sunset. These parameters are site-
    specific. They are 1, 3, and 0, respectively, for the San Joaquin valley of
    California and for Arizona, and 1, 4, and 2, respectively, for the coastal plain of
    israel.

    The wind speed during the night, from `t3` to `t1` next day (`wmin`) is assumed to
    be proportional to the daily total wind run. The ratio `wnytf` is also site-
    specific, `SitePar(4)`, (0.008 for San Joaquin and Arizona, 0.0025 for the coastal
    plain of Israel). wmin is the minimum wind speed from `t1` to `t3`.

    `wtday` is computed by subtracting the daily integral of wmin, after converting it
    from m/sec to km/day, from the total daily wind run (wndt).

    `wmax`, the maximum wind speed at time `t2` (minus `wmin`), is computed from wtday
    and converted to m/sec.

    `daywnd` from t1 to t2 is now computed as an increasing sinusoidal function from
    `wmin` to `wmin + wmax`, and it is computed from `t2` to `t3` as a decreasing
    sinusoidal function from `wmin + wmax` to `wmin`.

        """Computes and returns the hourly values of air temperature, using the
        measured daily maximum and minimum.

        The algorithm is described in Ephrath et al. (1996). It is based on the
        following assumptions:

        1. The time of minimum daily temperature is at sunrise.
        2. The time of maximum daily temperature is SitePar[8] hours after solar
        noon.

        Many models assume a sinusoidal curve of the temperature during the day,
        but actual data deviate from the sinusoidal curve in the following
        characteristic way: a faster increase right after sunrise, a near plateau
        maximum during several hours in the middle of the day, and a rather fast
        decrease by sunset. The physical reason for this is a more efficient mixing
        of heated air from ground level into the atmospheric boundary layer, driven
        by strong lapse temperature gradients buoyancy.

        NOTE: **will be used for "power" as in Fortran notation**.

        A first order approximation is

            daytmp = tmin + (tmax-tmin) * st * tkk / (tkk + daytmp - tmin)

        where

            st = sin(pi * (ti - SolarNoon + dayl / 2) / (dayl + 2 * SitePar[8]))

        Since daytmp appears on both sides of the first equation, it can be solved
        and written explicitly as:

            daytmp = tmin - tkk/2 + 0.5 * sqrt(tkk**2 + 4 * amp * tkk * st)

        where the amplitude of tmin and tmax is calculated as
            amp = (tmax - tmin) * (1 + (tmax - tmin) / tkk)
        This ensures that temperature still passes through tmin and tmax values.
        The value of tkk was determined by calibration as 15.

        This algorithm is used for the period from sunrise to the time of maximum
        temperature, hmax. A similar algorithm is used for the time from hmax to
        sunset, but the value of the minimum temperature of the next day
        (mint_tomorrow) is used instead of mint_today.

        Night air temperature is described by an exponentially declining curve.
        For the time from sunset to mid-night:

            daytmp = (mint_tomorrow - sst * exp((dayl - 24) / tcoef)
                    + (sst - mint_tomorrow) * exp((suns - ti) / tcoef))
                    / (1 - exp((dayl - 24) / tcoef))

        where tcoef is a time coefficient, determined by calibration as 4, sst is
        the sunset temperature, determined by the daytime equation as:

            sst = mint_tomorrow - tkk / 2 + 0.5 * sqrt(tkk**2 + 4 * amp * tkk * sts)

        where

            sts  = sin(pi * dayl / (dayl + 2 * SitePar[8]))
            amp = (tmax - mint_tomorrow) * (1 + (tmax - mint_tomorrow) / tkk)

        For the time from midnight to sunrise, similar equations are used, but the
        minimum temperature of this day (mint_today) is used instead of
        mint_tomorrow, and the maximum temperature of the previous day
        (maxt_yesterday) is used instead of maxt_today. Also, (suns-ti-24) is used
        for the time variable instead of (suns-ti).

        These exponential equations for night-time temperature ensure that the
        curve will be continuous with the daytime equation at sunset, and will pass
        through the minimum temperature at sunrise.
